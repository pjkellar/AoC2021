### AoC 2021
In and effort to save myself 5 seconds each day I created a little script that creates a new folder for the day and sets up the starter file and input and sample text files.

Example, typing this...
```bash
./seedNewDay.sh 03
```
...will
- create a new directory called "03"
- copy the files from the .seed directory into the new directory
- re-name starter.js to 03.js
- cd into the new directory so you are ready to start coding
